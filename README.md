# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This tells the story of what helps build a successful kickstarter campaign for Louise, who is hoping to have his own theatrical play. It deep dives into variances, means, medians, standard deviations to see what are the key influences to successful campaigns vs failed attempts.
My recommendation is for Louise to start his campaign in May or June since most of the successful campaigns started around that time of year. I would also implore Louise to shoot for a goal no higher than $5600 since the successful campaigns had a mean pledge of that amount. However, if Louise really needs the cash, he can also go for a goal of $9584 because that is still within a quartile of the mean that was pledged historically.
